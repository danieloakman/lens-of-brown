We shouldn’t have worried as both Sheridan and Daniel were great in explaining what they were trying to get in each photo, setting up environments that worked well for the kids and getting creative with prompts and distractions to help make them smile. Their choice of location and use of natural lighting and environment was also perfect. We got some amazing photos that we will cherish forever and couldn’t have made it work without them! Highly recommend to anyone looking to get a family shoot!",author:"Tim - Client",$$legacy:!0});var b=e(e(w,!0));p(b);var B=e(e(b,!0));L(B,{$$legacy:!0}),m(r,n)},$$slots:{default:!0},$$legacy:!0});var j=e(e(y,!0));C(j,{$$legacy:!0}),m($,v)}export{J as component,Z as universal};
